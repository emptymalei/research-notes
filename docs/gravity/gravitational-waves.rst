Gravitational Waves
==============================

As an estimation, the power of gravitation waves drop as :math:`1/r^2`. Thus the strain drops as :math:`1/r`.

For compact binary coalescence, the circular polarized wave at distance r is [Riles2013]_

.. math::
   h(t) =  \frac{1}{r} \left( \frac{5 G^5 M^5}{2 c^{11}} \right)^{1/4} \frac{1}{(t_{\mathrm{coal}} -t)^{1/4}},

which shows that the frequency diverges at :math:`t_{\mathrm{coal}}`.

In the astrophysicists' form, we have [Riles2013]_

.. math::
   h(\tau) = (1.7\times 10^{-23}) \left( \frac{15\mathrm{Mpc}}{r} \right) \left( \frac{1 \text{ day} }{\tau} \right)^{1/4} \left( \frac{M}{1.4M_{\odot}}\right)^{5/4}.


As an estimation, we can show that at :math:`r=1000 km` from the source,

.. math::
   h(\tau) \sim 10^{-6}\left( \frac{1 \text{ day} }{\tau} \right)^{1/4} \left( \frac{M}{1.4M_{\odot}}\right)^{5/4}.

As an example, we plot the evolution as a function of :math:`\tau` for 1.4 solar mass binaries.

   :align: center

   Binary mergers. In the beginning, gravitational waves are very strong.

.. admonition:: Strong Field
   :class: warning

   However, the problem is, for stong waves, this estimation fails. I need to find a paper that numerically calculates the strain for strong fields.

   **And I haven't found the right paper.**



The size of the disk of neutron star mergers are of the order :math:`10 km` [Foucart2012]_.
